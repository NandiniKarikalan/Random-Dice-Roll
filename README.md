🎲 Dicee – Random Dice Roll Game

A fun and interactive web-based dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Refresh the page to roll the dice and see who wins — Player 1, Player 2, or a draw!

🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML – Page structure and layout.
- CSS – Styling and typography.
- JavaScript – Dice logic and DOM manipulation.
- Google Fonts – Indie Flower & Lobster for playful aesthetics.

🎮 How It Works
- On page load, JavaScript generates two random numbers between 1 and 6.
- Each number maps to a dice image (dice1.png to dice6.png).
- The dice images update dynamically for both players.
- The heading displays the winner or a draw based on the roll.

🖼️ Visuals
- Dice images are stored in the images/ folder.
- Each dice face is represented by a separate PNG file.
